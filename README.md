The Teacher Position Reclassification and Digital Assessment Platform for DepEd is an advanced system that streamlines the process of teacher position reclassification and performance assessment within the Department of Education (DepEd). This platform allows teachers to submit their qualifications and performance data for evaluation. Evaluators, who work closely with district supervisors, play a crucial role in assessing and reclassifying teacher positions based on the submitted information. With features like digital assessment forms, automated calculations, and real-time notifications, the platform ensures a seamless, efficient, and transparent process, benefiting both teachers and administrators.
